# Kubernetes

CoreDNS can run in place of the standard Kube-DNS in Kubernetes. Using the *kubernetes*
plugin, CoreDNS will read zone data from a Kubernetes cluster. It implements the
spec defined for Kubernetes DNS-Based service discovery:

   https://github.com/kubernetes/dns/blob/master/docs/specification.md


## deploy.sh and coredns.yaml.sed

`deploy.sh` is a convenience script to generate a manifest for running CoreDNS on a cluster
that is currently running standard kube-dns. Using the `coredns.yaml.sed` file as a template,
it creates a ConfigMap and a CoreDNS deployment, then updates the Kube-DNS service selector
to use the CoreDNS deployment. By re-using the existing service, there is no disruption in
servicing requests.

The script doesn't delete the kube-dns deployment or replication controller - you'll have to
do that manually, after deploying CoreDNS.

You should examine the manifest carefully and make sure it is correct for your particular
cluster. Depending on how you have built your cluster and the version you are running,
some modifications to the manifest may be needed.

In the best case scenario, all that's needed to replace Kube-DNS are these two commands:

~~~
$ ./deploy.sh | kubectl apply -f -
$ kubectl delete --namespace=kube-system deployment kube-dns
~~~

NOTE: It is recommended to delete the kube-dns deployment. Otherwise, if both CoreDNS and kube-dns are running, queries may randomly hit either
CoreDNS or kube-dns.

For non-RBAC deployments, you'll need to edit the resulting yaml before applying it:
1. Remove the line `serviceAccountName: coredns` from the `Deployment` section.
2. Remove the `ServiceAccount`, `ClusterRole`, and `ClusterRoleBinding` sections.


在原模板下修改了下面选项
***原模板默认在群集里存在kube-dns，用于平滑升级---
***修改后的模板去除了平滑升级项 ***

部署方法可使用deploy.sh脚本
同时默认cluster_dns_ip 从kube-dns-svc获取，需要修改自定义dns地址和cluster_pod_cidr 地址。
例如。
脚本文件新增CLUSTER_DNS_IP=10.1.0.2
那么部署时候可以使用
deploy.sh -r 10.0.0.0/16 指定cluster_pod_cidr IP 生成coredns相关配置文件
